//--enhanced objects

//if you want to make object from variables
//you are repeating the code as the key and value are same
//like in example below




// let name = "Ahmed";

// let school = "SMIT";

// let obj = {
//     name:name,
//     school:school
// }

// console.log(obj)


//---enhanced object

//insteadof wrting proprty value and key again and again which are exactly same you can just ommit the value variable
//js will automatically understood that values are exactly same as properties and make the desired object automatically





let name = "Ahmed";

let school = "SMIT";

let obj = {
    name,
    school,
}

console.log(obj)
